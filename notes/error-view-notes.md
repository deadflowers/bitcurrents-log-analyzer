## Thoughts on Error View mode and Nginx Log Analysis

Below is is an outline that includes changes to error view, the general app. It also outlines many things that were until computers were stolen, on some iteration already completed to satisfaction. But am keeping the roadmap close so we can still see where the project is going which means more than where it has been.

### Goals
- Interpret Nginx error log entries and present them visually in a dashboard.
- Provide both security-focused insights (IP analysis) and error-type analysis.
- Keep the interface clean: avoid button clutter, prefer contextual popouts.

### Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Distribution of error types (e.g., connect() failed, directory index forbidden, upstream timed out).
- **Pie Chart (optional):** Severity level distribution (warn vs error vs crit).
- **Table View:** Continue showing IP, location, OS/Bot, and action options (allowlist, blocklist).
  - Extend "View" is already including:
    - requests count (if repeating ip)
    - Referrer
    - Full request (separately the URL, and agent string)
    - full available IP2Location API output
add 
    - Matched error message (if on error page mode)
or 
-  security violation (if in security mode and user tripped a sketchy path or method or port etc)

### IP Lookups
- Use ip2location.io to enrich each client IP with:
  - Country, region, city
  - ISP/ASN
  - Bot vs human classification (when available)

### Error Interpretation
- Match common Nginx error types and provide a short label/explanation:
  - `connect() failed` → Backend unreachable
  - `directory index ... forbidden` → Missing index.html or autoindex off
  - `no live upstreams` → All backends down
  - `client intended to send too large body` → Upload exceeded `client_max_body_size`
  - `worker_connections are not enough` → Resource limit exceeded
  - `upstream sent too big header` → Buffer tuning required
  - `upstream timed out` → Backend slow/unresponsive

### User Assistance
- Provide a **single popout called "Error Log Tips"** containing:
  - General troubleshooting guidance
  - Security warning signs (strange HTTP methods, many 404s to sensitive paths, suspicious long URIs)
  - Filtering advice (ignore favicon requests, common noise)
  - Quick references to config directives (`client_max_body_size`, `proxy_read_timeout`, etc.)
  ** don't go off the rails on this one. The idea is educate users beyond tooltips and this could feed a blog as well if the vendor wanted an excuse to cultivate a market of interactions **

### Filtering Rules
- Automatically filter out:
  - Requests for `/favicon.ico`
  - Well-known bot/spider requests, if already categorized
- Optionally group repetitive identical errors to reduce clutter.

### Layout Flow
1. Charts at the top (error type distribution, severity breakdown if enabled).
2. Table of IPs and error events (enriched with ip2location.io).
3. Action controls (allowlist/blocklist).
4. One general "Error Log Tips" popout for context.
5. User Tutorial Popout (escaped Markdown) for basic tips
