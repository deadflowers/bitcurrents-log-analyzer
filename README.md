# BitCurrents Log Analyzer

**A powerful, real-time Nginx log analyzer with a focus on security intelligence, performance monitoring, and beautiful data visualization. Powered by the IP2Location API.**

*![Video Demo](https://youtu.be/_bsR1jk-Mas?si=w3B-phr9dqv1ztgD)*

BitCurrents Analyzer turns raw Nginx logs into actionable insights. It moves beyond simple IP lookups to provide a rich, interactive dashboard that helps you understand your traffic, identify security threats, and diagnose server errors instantly. It's extremely lightweight as single-page web application, built with a Python/Flask backend and dynamic JavaScript frontend, private, nimble, customizable.

To get started clone the repo, install your virtual environment for pyth9n and some dependency files, run app.py, the go tonthe index file in your browser as 

`///home/name/bitcurrents/index.html` 

Then load the sample log file and choose analyze.

## üî• Key Features

### 1. Multi-Mode Analysis Dashboard
Switch between three distinct analysis modes, each with a purpose-built dashboard:

#### ‚ú® General Mode
Your command center for at-a-glance traffic overview.
-   **Rich KPI Cards:** Total Hits, Unique IPs, and critical counts of Impersonator and Suspicious traffic.
-   **Comprehensive Charting:**
    -   Traffic Breakdown (Human, Bots, Crawlers)
    -   Device Types (Desktop, Mobile)
    -   OS & Browser Distribution
    -   HTTP Status Code Distribution
    -   Top Countries & Top Successful Pages
-   **Powerful Filtering:** Instantly hide noisy IPs to see the real signal, and switch between analyzing Unique IPs vs. All Hits.

*![Main Dash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/947d71b1-dd58-4d06-9ef9-b813255c7cfa)*


#### üõ°Ô∏è Security Mode
Proactively hunt for threats and analyze attack patterns.
-   **Dynamic Threat Categories:** Filter logs for specific attack vectors like Config Exposure, Webshells, and WordPress probes using a configurable `security_patterns.json`.
-   **Targeted Visualizations:** See charts for Top Attack Categories and Top Attacking IPs.
-   **Bot Impersonator Detection:** Automatically flags traffic pretending to be a legitimate crawler from an unverified IP address.

*![Security Dash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89bb7272-8155-4888-a338-e7a2716f812c)*

#### üö® Error Mode
Quickly diagnose and understand server problems.
-   **Smart Error Parsing:** Intelligently categorizes common Nginx `error.log` messages (e.g., "Backend Unreachable," "Index Forbidden").
-   **Insightful Charts:** Visualize error types and severity levels to prioritize fixes.
-   **In-App Quick Guide:** A helpful "Error Log Tips" modal provides context and troubleshooting advice for common Nginx errors.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Hackathon Submission built for the IP2Location Programming Contest

This project leverages the power and precision of the **[IP2Location.io](https://www.ip2location.io/)** API to deliver advanced security features, including:
-   **High-Fidelity Geolocation:** Pinpointing the source of traffic with country, city, and ISP data.
-   **Intelligent Bot Detection:** Moving beyond simple user-agent strings.
-   **Bot Impersonator Flagging:** A critical security feature that verifies if traffic claiming to be from major crawlers (like Googlebot) is actually coming from their published IP ranges.


### Set Up: 

Clone this repository.

*   **Install pyenv:** If you don't have it, follow the installation guide. For macOS/Linux with Homebrew, it looks like this:
    
        `brew install pyenv`
    
Make sure to follow the post-install instructions to add pyenv init to your shell's startup script (.zshrc, .profile, .bashrc, etc.).

Then add these lines to your shell config (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):

    ```
    export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
    eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
    ```

Restart your shell so changes take effect.
    
*   **Install a Python Version:** Let's use a recent, stable version.
    
        `pyenv install 3.13.0`
      
*   **Create Your Project:**
    
        `git clone https://github.com/deadflowers/bitcurrents-log-analyzer`
    
        `cd bitcurrents-log-analyzer`
      
*   **Set the Local Python Version:** This command creates a .python-version file in your directory, so pyenv automatically uses this version whenever you're in this folder.
    
        `pyenv local 3.13.0`
      
*   **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment:** This is a best practice within your pyenv version to keep packages project-specific.
    
     Create the virtual environment folder named 'venv'
    `python -m venv .venv`
    
     Activate it
    
    `source .venv/bin/activate`

     Your terminal prompt should have in it `(.venv)`
      
*   **Install Dependencies:**
    
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      
*   **Set Up API Key:**
    
    *   Sign up for a free account at [IP2Location.io](https://ip2location.io) to get an API key. The free plan is quite capable.
        
    *   Create a file named .env in your project directory and add your key:
           
        `export IP2LOCATION_API_KEY=your-key`

Make sure your .venv is activated.
    
*   **SRun it:** In your terminal, inside the bitcurrents-log-analyzer directory, start the backend, and the front end
  
       `source .venv/bin/activate`

### Start Backend: Run the Python server:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Launch Frontend: 
Open `index.html` in your web browser as `file:///` path

### Analyze:
The dashboard will load with the new dark theme. 

- Enter the directory where your logs are stored or copied to.
- Optionally, enter a path fragment to track in the "Track Custom Path"
- Click the "Analyze Logs" button.

  Tip: in the app you can use sample logs provided `combined.log` in the main project folder. Just entr `.` as directory to search logs then choose in the next area specific file `combined.log`

The charts will populate, and the detailed IP table will appear below. You can now distinguish OS/Bot and any suspicious paths hit directly in the table.
- Add new paths to your watchlist on-the-fly using the "Add to Suspicious List" feature.

Being conservative with credits we keep an ip cache file as well automatically.

### NGINX

`combined.log` is a quick dump of nginx access logs. It is provided in the app as data to test. If you are not having luck when running your own, check your nginx config:

To display the referrer in Nginx access logs, ensure your `log_format` configuration includes the `$http_referer` variable.

I have in my `nginx.conf` the following:

```
# Logging
    log_format custom_format '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                          '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                          '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"';
    access_log		      /var/log/nginx/access.log custom_format;
    error_log              /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
```

Then in my domain conf:

```
# logging
    access_log              /var/log/nginx/site.com.access.log custom_format buffer=512k flush=1m;
    error_log               /var/log/nginx/site.com.error.log warn;
```

Reload

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

** note this app is being pieced back together last minute from memory and snippets in email as the equipment was all taken in a robbery. This project should be in working order if not it's final incarnaton by end of day today or tomorrow latest. And have more complete notes submitted ** 

Thanks for checking it out, let me know what you think. We look forward to future iterations and new features.
